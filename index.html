      Internships allow employers to discover new and unique talents, including
      prospective interns with disabilities. Many persons with disabilities have
      had to adapt and make adjustments to overcome challenges in their lives,
      and can bring innovative thinking, offer unique perspectives, and also
      propose ideas on how to make the business more inclusive for its
      customers. <br /><br />
